## Usage

Hit the 'Generate Password' button to begin the password generation.

A prompt box will appear asking for the password length in characters. Enter desired value between 10 and 64, making sure only an integer is entered. Any other value will not be valid, and the user will be asked to reenter.

Confirm or deny each of the lower-case, upper-case, numeric and special character sets to be included in the password when prompted. 

NOTE: At least once character set must be confirmed to produce a password.

An alert will inform that the password has been generated. The password will now be visible on the webpage, where it can be copied to the clipboard for use. 

Once the initial password has been generated, an replacement password can be generated by clicking the 'Generate Password' button again.
